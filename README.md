# UFO Analysis
## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to be able to present results for UFO sightings filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO ship or object sighted. The results are presented in a tabular form, and the filtering process has been made user-friendly as much as possible.

## Results:

![Webpage](https://github.com/SohaT7/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/webpage_1.png)

Our webpage contains a paragraph explaining how humans might not be alone in the universe, followed by a description of different viewpoints held in the UFO community: i.e. explore through the data to learn more about aliens versus those that ask for them to be left alone until they themselves wish to be found out.

The webpage then offers the user to decide for themselves if they wish to explore through the data of UFO sightings and if so, it offers them a user-friendly way to search through the data. 

![Filter Options](https://github.com/SohaT7/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/webpage_2.png)

The filters which they can apply to their search have been listed on the left-hand side of the webpage, and are as follows:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

The search results then show the data rows that fit with those filter values entered by the user. The results also include 'Duration' of sighting as well as any 'Comments' left by the observer.
It is not necessary for the user to enter a value in all the five filter options, as is illustrated below.

![Search results by 'City' and 'Shape'](https://github.com/SohaT7/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/city_shape.png)

For example, herein the filter values for only 'City' ('benton') and 'Shape' ('circle') were added, whereas in the one below the 'user' searched by only the 'Shape' filter, i.e. 'triangle'. It yields all search results that have a 'triangle' shaped object sighted therein.

## Summary:
This webpage is quite user-friendly to begin with. The layout, colors, and concisely laid out information all add to that user-friendly experience. However, the webpage has really dark-inked placeholder values in each of the filter search boxes. The placeholder values are: '1/10/2010', 'uxbridge', 'ma', 'us', and 'sphere'. The dark-colored placeholder values can be made way lighter (or done away with altogether). Alternatively, a small text can explain that these are only placeholder values and the user needs to enter some filter value to make the search specific to their purposes. It would also help if we can explain somewhere that in order to see All the results that were visible on the webpage initially, the user must erase the value they have entered in a filter box and also press 'Enter' to go back and view all the data values. Alternatively, and better still, we cna instead add one button that reads 'Filter Search' and another that reads 'Clear Search' to deal with this issue.
