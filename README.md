# UFO Analysis
## Overview of Project:
The purpose of this analysis was to be able to present results for UFO sightings filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO ship or object sighted. The results are presented in a tabular form, and the filtering process has been made user-friendly as much as possible.

## Results:
Our webpage contains a paragraph explaining how humans might not be alone in the universe, followed by a description of different viewpoints held in the UFO community: i.e. explore through the data to learn more about aliens versus those that ask for them to be left alone until they themselves wish to be found out.

The webpage then offers the user to decide for themselves if they wish to explore through the data of UFO sightings and if so, it offers them a user-friendly way to search through the data. The filters which they can apply to their search have been listed on the left-hand side of the webpage, and are as follows:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

The search results then show the data rows that fit with those filter values entered by the user. The results also include 'Duration' of sighting as well as any 'Comments' left by the observer.
It is not necessary for the user to enter a value in all the five filter options, as is illustrated below.
